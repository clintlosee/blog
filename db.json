That is where the FizzBuzz test comes in. The FizzBuzz test is where you are tasked with writing a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\".\n\nThis sounds easy enough, but when I first attempted it I got stuck. So more reading and more research helped me through this and I came up with as basic example solution:\n\n``` javascript\nfor (var i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {\n    if (i % 15 == 0) {\n        console.log('FizzBuzz');\n    } else if (i % 3 == 0) {\n        console.log('Fizz');\n    } else if (i % 5 == 0) {\n        console.log('Buzz');\n    } else {\n        console.log(i);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd after more researching, I came across an even more consolidated and concise version of the above:\n\n``` javascript\nfor (var i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {\n    var f = i % 3 == 0, b = i % 5 == 0;\n    console.log(f ? b ? \"FizzBuzz\" : \"Fizz\" : b ? \"Buzz\" : i);\n}\n```\n\nIt still takes me a few times reading through that last version to fully grasp how it is doing what it is in only four lines of code compared to 11. It's always great to see differing versions of how to solve the same concept.\n\nIf you're trying to get the basics of JavaScript down and are looking for some coding exercises, I highly recommend looking into tests such as __the FizzBuzz Test__ as well and the many JavaScript assessments and articles regarding [JavaScript interview questions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95).

Most CSS experts out there are already going to know this one, but for those of you that are just learning, here's a quick tip that could help you out in the long run.\n\n## Opacity Problem\n\nWhat I needed was to set the background color of a div and then adjust its opacity to give it that cool see-through look. However, when setting the opacity property to something like 0.5 it adjusted the text inside the div along with the background. Not very cool.\n\nUsual CSS block (sets opacity of box and text within it:\n\n``` css\n    .box {\n        background-color: #000;\n        opacity: 0.5;\n    }\n```\n\n### Solution:\n\nHere's the quick little snippet that I came across that is sure to save you a bunch of time: RGBA values.\n\nBetter to use:\n\n``` css\n    .box {\n        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\n    }\n```\n\nThat's right. Set your background color using rgba. The syntax for this is: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5). Basically you set your red, green and blue values between 0 and 255. Then you set your opacity level just as you would with opacity such 0.5 for 50% opacity.\n\nYou can see an example of this in the following Codepen:\n\n<p data-height=\"350\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"RWjadj\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"clintlosee\" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/clintlosee/pen/RWjadj/'>RGBA Example</a> by Clint Losee (<a href='http://codepen.io/clintlosee'>@clintlosee</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>\n<script async src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\n\nThe first box shows the RGBA example where the text still has no opacity level applied to it but the background has 50% opacity applied. The second box has the opacity set to 50% but it is applying to the box and text within, making them all lighter than what the intended outcome should be.\n\nFor the CSS veterans out there, this won't be anything new. But for those getting into CSS, it can be a huge help.\n","source":"_posts/css3-background-opacity.md","raw":"---\ntitle: CSS3 Background Opacity\ndate: 2015-10-19 01:16:01\nintro:\ncategory:\n- CSS\ntags:\n- Development\n- Front-End\n---\n![CSS3 Background Opacity](/blog/images/css3-background-opacity.jpg)\n\nHere's something that I came across recently that proved incredibly useful.

So I figured I could potentially help some people out who are new to React and provide a solution to what I’ve found on this error.\n\nWhat’s this error, or warning, you may be asking? Well it’s this:\n\n`Warning: React.createElement: type should not be null, undefined, boolean, or number. It should be a string (for DOM elements) or a ReactClass (for composite components).`\n\nOr this one:\n\n`Uncaught Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.`\n\nWhat causes this? Well here’s what I’ve found can cause this often very frustrating error when you’re starting out in React Development.\n\nWithout going into all of the setup and inner-workings of a React site or component, there are two common scenarios I’ve seen that cause these errors. One instance is when setting up routing in your app using [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router). In this case, you have your Routes.jsx file (or whatever you name your routing file) and inside that file you have something set up like the following:\n\n``` javascript\nvar React = require('react');\nvar ReactRouter = require('react-router');\nvar Router = ReactRouter.Router;\nvar Route = ReactRouter.Route;\n\nvar Base = require('./components/base.jsx');\nvar PageOne = require('./components/pageone.jsx');\nvar PageTwo = require('./components/pageTwo.jsx');\n\nvar Router = (\n    <Router>\n    \t<Route path=\"/PageOne\" component= {PageOne}></Route>\n    \t<Route path=\"/pageTwo\" component= {PageTwo}></Route>\n    </Router>\n);\n\nmodule.exports = Router;\n```\n\nYou’ll notice when creating var Router it is set up using (…). This isn’t creating a React Class like you usually would with React.createClass. That means you need to set this up differently in your main.jsx file. In that file, when rendering a component with React-DOM you would do something like the following:\n\n``` javascript\nvar React = require(\"react\");\nvar ReactDOM = require(\"react-dom\");\nvar ListManager = require('./components/ListManager.jsx');\n\nReactDOM.render(<ListManager />, document.getElementById('ght'));\n```\n\nHowever, when rendering your routes file where you did not create a React class, you would need to use the following format (pay attention to the ReactDOM.render method):\n\n``` javascript\nvar React = require(\"react\");\nvar ReactDOM = require(\"react-dom\");\nvar Routes = require('./routers.jsx');\n\nReactDOM.render(Routes, document.getElementById('ght'));\n```\n\nWhen setting up this type of routing, you omit the <... /> from your render method and just use your variable name for your route file. Watch out for that if you are running into this error when starting out learning React. If that isn’t the case, check out the next one.\n\n### Another Scenario For This React Error\nAnother scenario I have come across in helping others out with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a common error in JavaScript in general.\n\nOne of the weird parts of JavaScript has to do with semicolons. Debates abound about this and I’m not going to get into it. ES2015 helps this issue out, but again, that’s another topic.\n\nWhat I’m talking about is how JavaScript terminates line endings. You may not be aware but JavaScript sees the end of a line and can sometimes insert it’s very own little semicolon without you wanting it to. This can cause huge problems, especially on return statements. Here’s what I’m talking about and where I’ve seen this in React.\n\nTake the following code plucked from a React component:\n\n``` javascript\nvar List = React.createClass({\n    render: function(){\n    \tvar createItem = function(text,index){\n    \t\treturn <ListItem key={ index + text} text = {text} />;\n    \t};\n\n    \treturn\n        (\n            <ul>\n                {this.props.items.map(createItem)}\n            </ul>\n        );\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThe return statement in the React class shows the return and then the `(` on the next line. This is a common coding convention in many other languages, one such is Java. This can cause some major problems in JavaScript though. What you need to make sure you do to format this is as follows (return statement pulled out of the above code for reference):\n\n``` javascript\nreturn (\n    <ul>\n        {this.props.items.map(createItem)}\n    </ul>\n);\n```\n\nMove that `(` up to directly after your return statement and you can save yourself loads of time researching errors of undefined being returned.
