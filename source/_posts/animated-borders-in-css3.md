![Animated Borders in CSS3](/blog/images/animated-borders-css3.jpg)

Recently for a project I wanted to utilize a little CSS3 animation for something that was a little outside of the norm of what we typically use. Sometimes utilizing a little bit of animation on something such as a button or link can help to bring a little more attention to it and help the user enjoy their experience on your site.

Previous user testing of our website at my current job resulted in finding out that our website was just plain boring to use. It's somewhat hard to make an e-commerce site super fun to use ;). We have since implemented some more aesthetic flair to the site to help combat this, and the option of adding a little flair to this new project was right up that alley.

## Animated Borders in CSS3

Basically what I wanted to do was use some state icons for users to click. I didn't want to do a simple CSS hover effect and be done with it though. I had previously seen a similar effect on [Codepen](http://www.codepen.io "Codepen") for animated the borders of a button. So I wanted to re-create that same effect. _(I wish I had the link to the original...I'll update this as soon as I can find it.)_

<p data-height="350" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="JYjWRW" data-default-tab="result" data-user="clintlosee" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/clintlosee/pen/JYjWRW/">Animated Border Button</a> by Clint Losee (<a href="http://codepen.io/clintlosee">@clintlosee</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

While this isn't the same exact result I ended up using (I used the icons and animated the borders around those boxes), this effect can be used for many different elements. In this pen I used a button and animated the effect over the button borders. In the end, it was a fun effect that added a little bit of something to the page.
